  "KintaiActor — the kintai (勤怠) attendance actor as a
  `langgraph.graph/state-graph` (ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors
  section). One graph run = one attendance operation request
  (intake → advise → govern → decide → commit/hold, with a
  human-approval interrupt for escalated proposals). No infinite internal
  loop; checkpointed per superstep so an interrupted run can resume after
  human sign-off. Modeled on cloud-itonami-isco-4313's payroll.actor.

  ```text
  :intake -> :advise -> :govern -> :decide -+-> :commit            (:ok? true)
                                            +-> :request-approval  (:escalate? true, interrupt-before)
                                            +-> :hold              (:hard? true)
  ```

  The unconditional invariant: the KintaiAdvisor can never directly
  commit a record the KintaiGovernor refuses — every store write is
  gated behind `:decide`. Approving attendance is always escalated
  (those hours become payroll input), and a period whose jurisdiction
  has no rule set is HELD rather than escalated: there is no human whose
  sign-off substitutes for a statute nobody has encoded."
